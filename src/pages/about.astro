              Our Story
            </span>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">How Seabreeze started</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              At Mckenna’s Seabreeze, our journey began with a simple goal: to help more people feel confident, capable, and connected on the water. What started as a handful of small group lessons for the armed forces along the south coast has grown into a trusted sailing and water skills school based in the heart of Southampton. Founded by experienced instructors with a deep love for the sea, Seabreeze was built on the belief that time on the water can be both empowering and life-changing—whether you’re setting sail for the first time or sharpening advanced techniques.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              With over 15 years of experience in the watersports industry, we’ve created a learning environment that’s welcoming, supportive, and professional. We offer a range of RYA-accredited courses, from dinghy sailing and powerboat training to classroom-based theory and safety courses. These are all delivered by passionate, certified instructors who know how to make learning enjoyable and effective.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
              Our values are simple: safety, confidence, and respect for the water. We take the time to get to know our learners, tailoring instruction to suit different abilities and learning styles. Whether you’re 8 or 80, we believe everyone should have access to high-quality, confidence-building experiences on the water.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
              Set against the stunning backdrop of the Royal Southampton Yacht Club, our training centre provides the ideal conditions for learning and adventure. At Seabreeze, you won’t just leave with a certificate, you’ll leave with new skills, confidence, and a deeper connection to the water.
